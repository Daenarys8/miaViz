# miaViz

## Microbiome Analysis Plotting and Visualization

The scope of this package is the plotting and visualization of microbiome data.
The main classes for interfacing should be either the `TreeSummarizedExperiment`
or the `MicrobiomeExperiment` class.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute by forking and opening a pull request. Please make sure
that required data wrangling should be designed as reusable as possible and
potentially find a better home in the [`mia`](https://github.com/FelixErnst/mia)
package.

Additionally, please make sure that working examples are included and that 
vignetted make use of added functions in either `miaViz` or the
[`MicrobiomeExperiment`](https://github.com/FelixErnst/MicrobiomeExperiment)
package.

## Technical aspects

Let's use a git flow kind of approach. Development version should be done 
against the `master` branch and then merged to `release` for release.
